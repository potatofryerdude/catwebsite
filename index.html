  <img class="intro-pic" src="amongus" alt="Uh oh a pigeon must've broken your computer <:(" /> <!--I decided to add some images because cats are the best and they should be everywhere. I have an alt attribute in case the image doesnt load. I also put it into a class so that I can group all of the the images at the beginning in one group and make them the same size.-->
