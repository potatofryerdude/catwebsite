  <p class="intro"> Welcome to the largest community of cat lovers (totally), we all know that cats are the best animal in the world (altough all of them are amazing except pigeons) so lets just be nice and have a great time. Have fun!</p>
  <img class="intro-pic" src="https://i.postimg.cc/VLXVXsk9/gauchoisdeadintro.jpg" alt="Uh oh a pigeon must've broken your computer <:(" /> <!--I decided to add some images because cats are the best and they should be everywhere. I have an alt attribute in case the image doesnt load. I also put it into a class so that I can group all of the the images at the beginning in one group and make them the same size.-->
