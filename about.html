<p class="intro"> Hello, I'm actually a cat. I was inspired to make a website from scratch through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I was always interested in how websites worked and its just something that I have used for so many years. I hope to continue expanding my knowledge in this area and make much better websites that this one but anyways have a good day! </p>
